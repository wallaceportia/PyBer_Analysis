# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the CEO V.Isualize of PyBer an app based ride sharing company with insights on its ride sharing operation.  These insights will be used to assess the ride sharing services and deterimine affordability for the underserved neighorboods.  To determine the equatability of the ride sharing service, the service will be evaluated using three city types: Rural, Suburban and Urban.  For futher analysis, number of drivers, number or rides, and sum of fares by city type will also be considered.  The summarization of the data, that should clearly define, the differences within the framework of city-type will be utilized to make business improvement decisions at PyBer. 

## Results 
###### Total number of rides for each city type (Refer to Table 1 Summary Data)
  * In rural environs the total number of rides is 125. 
  * In suburban areas the total number of rides is 625 which is 5 times the amount of rural rides.
  * In urban areas the total number of rides is 1625 which is 13 times the amount of rural rides and just over 2.5 more than suburban areas

 ###### Total number of drivers for each city type (Refer to Table 1 Summary Data)
  * In rural environs the total number of drivers is 78. 
  * In suburban areas the total number of drivers is 490 which is just over 6 times the amount of rural drivers.
  * In urban areas the total number of drivers is 2405 which is approximately 32 times the amount of rural drivers and approximately 5 times more drivers than suburban areas

 ###### Total fares for each city type (Refer to Table 1 Summary Data)
 * In rural environs the total fares is $4,327.93
 * In suburban areas the total fares is $19,356.33 approximately 4.5 times the amount for rural areas 
 * In urban areas the total fares is $39,854.38 which is approximately 2 times the amount of suburban areas and approximately just over 9.5 times more than rural areas 

 ###### Average fare per ride for each city type(Fares by city type/rides by city type) (Refer to Table 1 (Summary Data)
 * The average fare per ride in for rural areas is $34.62
 * The average fare per ride in suburban areas is $30.97 just about $4.00 less than rural fares
 * The average fare per ride in uban areas is $24.53 just about $6.00 less than suburban fares and appoximately less than $10.00 less than rural fares
 
 ###### Average fare per driver for each city type(Total fares/total drivers) (Refer to Table 1 (Summary Data)
  * The average fare per driver in rural areas is $55.44
  * The average fare per driver in suburban areas is $39.50 approxiamately $15.00 less than rural drivers
  * The average fare per driver in urban areas is $16.57, approxiamately 2.5 times less than suburan drivers and approximately 3.5 times less than than rural drivers

###### Weekly Fares Analysis (Refer to Table 2 "Pyber Weekly Fare by City-Type and Line Graph Total Weekly Fares)
  As can be seen visually in the line graph rural fares contribute approximately 5 to 10 % of weekly fares the least amount. Whereas suburban fares contribute about 30 to 40%     of total fares the second highest amount. Lastly Urban fares consistently contribute 90 to 100 percent of the total fares.(Line Graph Total Weekly Fares)
## Highs and Lows

###### Highs
  * The top three highest totals for rural fares are: $504.24, $419.06 and $333.08; these occur in the months of April, February and February consecutively 
  * The top three highest totals for suburban fares are: $1412.74, $1357.75 and $1218.20; these occur in the months of February, April and January consecutively
  * The top three highest totals for urbans fares are $ $2470.93, $2466.29 and $2390.72; these occur in the months of March, February and April consecutively
 ###### Lows
  * The lowest three totals for rural fares are $ 115.80, $95.82, $67.65; these occur in the months of February, February and January consecutively
  * The lowest three totals for suburban fares are $ $858.96, $784.82, $721.60; these occur in the months March, April and January consecuetively 
  * The lowest three totals for urban fares are $ 1942.77, $1939.02,$1661.08; ; these occur in the months March, January and January consecutively

### Summary
Analysing the data in "Table 1"  we determined that the most number of rides are in urban areas, 1625 which is 13 times the amount of rural rides and just over 2.5 more than suburban areas. These numbers are likely to be consistent with most urban cities; urban cities tend to have large populations, many of whom are likely to consume services such as ride sharing. This of course is influnced by the fact that homes tends to be in close proximity in urban areas, and similarly in suburban areas,though not as tightly packed. This would differ greatly in rural areas where homes tend to very spaced out.

As would then be expected and evidenced in Table 1 urban areas have the largest number of drivers totally 2405 which is approximately 32 times the amount of rural drivers which is 78 and approximately 5 times more drivers than suburban areas, which is 490. These numbers are likely consistent with most urban cities not in that the numbers being exact but most drivers will be attracted by the volume of riders in urban areas. 

The average fare per driver in urban areas is $16.57, approxiamately 2.5 times less than suburan drivers who make $39.50 and approximately 3.5 times less than than rural drivers who make $55.44. These numbers of course are directly impacted by the number drivers. 

As can be observed in the line plot the months or weeks of the year does not greatly influence the total fares, directly impacted by the total rides. There are some weeks where there are obviously dips in ridership but without knowing other economic practices in the city that PyBer operates or personal information about financial constraints by riders it is difficult to hypothesize what the exactly influence is.  For example it is reasonalble that individuals might be paid bi-weekly and this may influence when they are more social and consuming ride sharing. In rural areas the three highes fares might be influnced by time of month, as observed the three highest fares occured, April 7th, Feb 24th and Feb 3rd, which seems to be clustered towards the beginning of the month or the end of the month, it might be that individuals get out more when they are paid.  This is however an assuption. 

The main purpose of this analysis however was to determine if underserved populations were being equitably served by PyBer and what changes it should make based on the data. It is not explicitly stated that drivers for PyBer purchase there own cars or if the cars are provided by the company.  However it would seem that if the company provides the cars that ride sharing would not be the most effective business model for rural areas. It contributes the least the the companies profits.  It would seem logical that most people living in rural areas will own their own cars and will less likely be interested in ride sharing.  It does not seem from the trend that it is the fare price that is influencing the number of rides or the availability of drivers but perhaps the hidden influence is lifestyle. It is factual that the proximity of homes will be much further apart than in suburban and urban areas; this factor will also make ride sharing a less attrative option of travel for rural dwellers. Therefore incresing the number of drivers in order to impact cost per ride would not be effective. PyBer might consider a taxi for hire service for its' rural customers.
